## Control Categories

Cybersecurity controls are grouped into **three main categories**, each addressing different aspects of risk management.

### 1. Administrative / Managerial Controls

- Define how the organization manages data and assigns employee responsibilities.  
- Examples:  
  - Security policies and procedures  
  - Employee training and awareness programs  
  - Access control policies  
  - Incident response and data handling procedures  

### 2. Technical Controls
- Involve **technological solutions** designed to protect systems and data.  
- Examples:  
  - Firewalls  
  - Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)  
  - Antivirus software  
  - Data encryption  
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)  

### 3. Physical / Operational Controls
- Protect **physical assets** from unauthorized access or damage.  
- Examples:  
  - Door and cabinet locks

## Control Types

1. **Preventive Controls** – Stop incidents before they occur (e.g., firewalls, access restrictions).  
2. **Corrective Controls** – Restore systems after an incident (e.g., patches, backups).  
3. **Detective Controls** – Identify when a security event occurs (e.g., IDS, logs).  
4. **Deterrent Controls** – Discourage malicious activity (e.g., warning signs, CCTV).
